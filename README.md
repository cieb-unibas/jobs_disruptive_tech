# **Spreading Out: The Adoption of Disruptive Technologies in Switzerland**

This repository contains the material (code, images) to replicate the CIEB analysis regarding the spread of disruptive technologies across Switzerland based on job postings data. 

New ideas and technologies power the engine of modern economies. Some technologies have limited impact in particular industries of the economy. But others, such as autonomous driving or cloud computing, are sometimes labeled as *disruptive* because they strongly transform processes within entire industries or even affect the overall economy. To what extent have disruptive technologies spread in Switzerland? Find out more in our report: LINK
